Halting development on Generator.py for now.

Reasoning:
	* Hard to predict required general features before building at least one 
	generator


Untethering erdos_renyi.py from Generator.py

Reasoning:
	* Due to above, Generator.py may not be all that useful as a template


Beginning graph analysis suite in Analysis/Graphs. Aim is to provide easy access 
to common graph properties. This is probably redundant for some measures, since 
they are likely provided by Scipy or Numpy, but this was I can ensure 
customizability.

Completed (tentatively):
	* component analysis
	* order
	* size


Barely started Barabasi-Albert model generator.
